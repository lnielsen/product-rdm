# InvenioRDM Roadmap

This repository tracks the high-level roadmap of InvenioRDM. The tasks included in the roadmap are tasks that are currently being worked on by InvenioRDM partner(s) or where resources have been assigned to the task:

- [Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/inveniosoftware/projects/80/views/9)
- [Feature requests](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/product-rdm/discussions/categories/ideas)

## Feature requests

- Open a [new feature request](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/product-rdm/discussions/new?category=ideas)

## Workflow

The roadmap is updated quarterly in Jan, Apr, Jul and Oct. All partners add tasks to the roadmap they work on, and the roadmap is discussed in the bi-weekly InvenioRDM telecon.

- Step 1: Ideas/feature requests are discussed.
- Step 2: InvenioRDM partners open an issue for tasks they are working on, or planning to work on in the near future (i.e. have assigned resources to).
- Step 3: The issue is added to roadmap project board.

The roadmap does not track any dates, only the upcoming version and planned features (in a future release). 

## Issues

An issue/task should track:

- a responsible person (assignee)
- the partner organisation(s) participating
- the targeted release
- requirements (motivation, user stories)
- technical design documents (mockups, data model, REST APIs, programmatic API etc)
